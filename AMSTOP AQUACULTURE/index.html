        <h2>Our history</h2>
            <p>Amstop Concept was registered with CAC on (october 24th 2017), initially it was registered AMSTOP WEST AFRICAN LIMITED about two and half decades
                founded by Mr Adelani Majekadegbe. He is a determined entrepreneur from Lagos with a vision to provide fresh, 
                affordable catfish to the growing urban population. After noticing the high demand for fish in the city, 
                he left his corporate job and invested in catfish farming. Starting small with a few ponds on the outskirts of Lagos,
                Adelani faced challenges but focused on quality and sustainability. In that same year, Amstop gained recognition for its premium catfish, 
                supplying local markets and restaurants. Today, Amstop Concept Enterprises is a thriving business that
                supports the local economy and offers fresh, sustainably farmed fish to the Lagos community.
